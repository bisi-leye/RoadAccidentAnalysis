# RoadAccidentAnalysis
The Road Accident Analysis project aims to identify patterns, trends, and contributing factors to road accidents in Nigeria for the year 2023. The goal of the project is to gain insights into the causes of road accidents and develop strategies for accident prevention and mitigation.

In this project, I carried out an exploratory data analysis to generate insight into the contributing factors to road accidents across states, the vehicle category and type that were mostly involved in road accidents, the severity of road accidents, and the frequency of victim casualty and fatality.
